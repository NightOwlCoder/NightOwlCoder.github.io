Learning new things brings us mixed feelings sometimes.

Probably you have already felt something like this in your mind:

>  I wanna know about this, but I wish I was learning it with that other method/language/framework I prefer.

I was learning `dagger`, but the [tutorial](https://dagger.dev/tutorial/){:target="_blank"} code samples are in `java`.

Here came my good friend [Augusto Pedroza](https://github.com/augustopedroza){:target="_blank"} to the rescue. He converted the tutorial code to [Kotlin](https://github.com/augustopedroza/daggerTutorial){:target="_blank"}!

Great, now he made it easier for me to learn in what has become my preferred language by far.

Hope you also like his effort.
