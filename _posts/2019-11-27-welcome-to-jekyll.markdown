Jekyll has a great support for syntax highlighting, by default, Jekyll utilizes [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/), which is a pure ruby-based code highlighter. Rouge can highlight 100 different [languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers). 

Code formatting can be done with `{% raw %}{% highlight ruby %}{% endraw %}`.

As you can see, you especify the language right there, even line numbers are supported by adding `linenos`, ending with something like like:

 ```
 {% raw %}{% highlight ruby linenos%}{% endraw %}
 ```
 
 A full run would be like:

{% highlight ruby linenos %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
