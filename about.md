I've to add something about me here, but to start, how about a picture?

What that tells you?

First that I like to code, a lot, even if on top of a tree.<br>
Second, I like to focus and just stay in the zone, relentless, even if the day turns into night.

But what about code your code skills, you ask?<br>

Well, starting with languages, `C#` is my passion, followed really close by `Kotlin` and `Java`. Actually nowadays `Kotlin` is bringing me a lot of happiness. `Lambdas`, wow! Aside from those mainstream, I also know `C`, `C++`, `Z-80 assembler`, remember that one? A lot of other assembly languages not worth mentioning here, `SQL`, and some other more obscure ones.
The important point to understand is that for me, a language is just a dialect a computer speaks, so learning a new one is just as fun as coding.<br>

Now thinking about app design and framework, that is my joy for sure. I like to architect a whole app, connecting it to some awesome backend service, be it `AWS`, `Azure` or `Google Cloud`. Have I told you about 2019, the year I spent around 10 months connecting one app targeted for end users with devices (running a sort of Android in Kiosk mode) around the globe? I used `API Gateway`, `Lambda`, `Dynamo DB`, `S3` and `IoT`, all `AWS services` for the integration. Unfortunately, I can’t detail it too much here, but we can talk more over the phone or during an interview.<br>

I’m also knowledgeable in `Agile`, `Scrum`, `Jira`, `DevOps`, you name it, `software life cycle` is my thing. In another company, I successfully implemented `VSTS` on the cloud (now `DevOps`), replacing their old system with a fresh and more user-friendly system. I had to develop some webhooks for some services running in Azure to make some calculations, sums and validations that were not available on the out-of-the-box product.<br>
